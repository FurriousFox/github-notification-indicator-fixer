# GitHub notification indicator fixer

Fixes notification indicator when cause of notification get removed, which causes the notification itself to disappear (making it impossible to mark it as read), but not the indicator.

Often happens when you get notified by a spam/scam issue (e.g. "GitCoin"), and GitHub removing the repo, and the notification... but not the irritating notification indicator.

## how to use

- generating a new [**Classic** PAT (personal access token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), granting the "notifications" permission.
- [visit the github pages](https://furriousfox.github.io/github-notification-indicator-fixer/)
- either choose to mark everything as "read" or as "done"
- wait until the it's done
